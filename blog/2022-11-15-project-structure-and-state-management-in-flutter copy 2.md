Flutter is a compelling technology but it is not very mature so there are some challenges when it comes to filling in the functionality that is missing from the core libraries. I have spent a lot of time reading different blogs, etc. to try to get some guidance and hopefully avoid some common pitfalls. One resource that has been useful is [codewithandrea.com](https://codewithandrea.com/tutorials/). I am going to be referencing his riverpod and other architecture articles to inform my library architectural decisions.
