# Distributing with Google Play Store

I was at first using Firebase to deploy but the process to get the app was not user friendly for test users. It would warn users that the developer was not recognized, etc.

So I figured that I would get a developer account which quickly led to me getting set up with google play store as the test app distribution strategy instead.

In the process of doing this, a few things happened:
I got set up with AAB (used to be APKs) and I let the play store manage my app signing key.
We may want to look into managing our own key before distributing to a larger audience
I also believe that I created an upload key on my machine…
I had to hack through a few app verification steps
Wrote some BS about why we need location services (I don’t know why element asks for location)
And some other things that I forget now…
I paid $25 for the developer account
