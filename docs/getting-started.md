# Welcome to the Quiri project!
Quiri is a chat app designed to host your most meaningful conversations. The primary component of this project is a custom built flutter mobile client. The backend is just a deployment of a standard matrix chat server.

Hopefully you are here because you have some interest in contributing!
Email Nigel at nigel.maynard@quiri.io and I will add you to the github org and discord server.
